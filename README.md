#FlowerGrow

A game where you are a flower trying to stay hydrated and alive on your way of growing into the sky. Your enemies are the bad clouds and the bees. They will decrease your water level if you accidentally hit them, so you will need to avoid them to stay alive. While you're growing higher your water level will also be negativeliy affected. Because of this you desperately need to chase the good rain clouds to increase your water level and stay hydrated.
